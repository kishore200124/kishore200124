Hola! I'm KISHORE S ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on effective engineering solutions for the better future. I have a bachelors in Biomedical and a strong background knowledge in Embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence. Getting a life changing product into the hands of people is my calling

ðŸ‘¯ I have Profound knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Sinal Processing, Pattern recognition and Embedded system Design. Proficient in Simulation software : Matlab and OpenSim with good Programming skills in C, C++ and Python.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Biomedical,Deep Learning and Data Processing.


âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not working I'm likely to hear music, yelling at athletes on TV who can't hear me, reading anything I can find on Steve Jobs and Muhammad Ali and I go by the motto â€œCharacter consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries" -->
